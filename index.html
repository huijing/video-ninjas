    <h2>Set #4</h2>
    <p>Set #4 is stored in the Engineers.SG locker at Hackerspace.SG.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Set up the camera with the camera stand. Make sure the camera is plugged into a power supply. The video camera is an independent setup from the screen recording. Try to capture the speaker with a bit of his/her slides so it's easier to do a post-production sync if anything goes wrong.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>General setup will look something like this for a typical projector using HDMI. Refer to step #5 if projector uses VGA cables.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Connect the screen recorder to your own laptop. Make sure you have installed <a href="http://gamerzone.avermedia.com//support/download/live_gamer_portable">RECentral</a> on your laptop.</li>
          <li>Connect the output from the voice recorder to the screen recorder.</li>
          <li>Connect the screen recorder to the output 2 of the splitter.</li>
          <li>Connect output 1 of the splitter to the projector.</li>
          <li>Connect the speaker's laptop to the input of the splitter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If using the voice recorder, make sure you place the microphone side of the recorder facing the speaker.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Open the Preferences for RECentral, and under Capture, set the Audio Source to External LR, if using the voice recorder.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event your project uses VGA, reverse the setup for outputs on the splitter.</p>
        <img class="c-vimg" src="img/splitter-to-screen-rec.jpg" alt="Screen recorder to splitter">
        <ul>
          <li>Connect the screen recorder to output 1 of the splitter.</li>
          <li>Connect output 2 to the HDMI-VGA converter for the projector.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If things really go south, make sure that the main video camera is working fine, and try to angle the camera in a place which captures both the speakers and the slides. Check that the lighting is suitable to capture the content projected on the screen for this particular instance.</p>
